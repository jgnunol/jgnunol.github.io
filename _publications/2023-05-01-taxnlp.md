Taxation is often implemented to discourage the consumption of sugary drinks. Portion cap rules have been proposed to achieve the same end. Some are skeptical of portion cap rules due to concerns about consumer harm and reduced choice. It is unclear how taxes and cap rules compare in terms of these concerns. We report an experiment contrasting the impacts of both measures in a single-product market with two types of privately-informed buyers. Sellers face demand from an automated buyer with either low or high preference for the product. We manipulate the regulatory environment across treatments: unregulated, taxed, and limited by a cap. When under a cap rule, sellers offered two alternatives to serve both consumer segments just as frequently as in the baseline group. With a tax, sellers were more likely to reduce availability as their pricing tended to exclude buyers with low preference. Consumer surplus remains unaffected under the cap rule, while buyers with high willingness to pay for the product see their surplus diminished by the tax. We conclude that taxation is not clearly superior to portion cap rules when both interventions achieve equivalent reductions in consumption and consumer welfare is of primary concern.
